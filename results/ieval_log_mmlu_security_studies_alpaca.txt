predicted:	A. Environmental challenges to economic growth, such as natural resource management and employment, leads to diversification and research which may in the long-term result in technological advancements that bolster military programs. | gold:	B
predicted:	A. The global economy is interconnected, ensuring that energy security for one is dependent upon energy security for all. Thus all core powers have the same interests in maintaining and extending the conditions under which this market operates. As long as this economic order exists, conflict between major powers over energy reserves is highly unlikely. | gold:	A
predicted:	D. All of these options. | gold:	D
predicted:	A. State responses to transnational crime have evolved in correlation to the increased threat posed to the integrity of the state. Organized crime has been regarded primarily as a national security threat to be addressed domestically. The institutionalized international approaches for information sharing have been predominately bilateral to the extent of bringing to justice perpetrators of crime that are seeking to evade justice. | gold:	B
predicted:	A. The main disciplinary context for security studies theorizing was a move away from the disciplinary domination of political science toward multi-academe interaction from sociology, mathematics, psychology, natural and political sciences, and economics. | gold:	C
predicted:	C. Property Rights: legal reforms to secure property rights without excessive costs and to regularize the informal sector. | gold:	D
predicted:	D. Computer networks. | gold:	A
predicted:	C. The USA has sought to assert its primacy vis-à-vis friendly and rival powers, through the deployment of troops and other interventions. | gold:	B
predicted:	A. Conventional constructivists view constructivism as a bridge between rationalist and reflectivist approaches, enabling both to benefit from the insights of the other. Conversely, critical constructivists argue that this approach simply reproduces the binary distinctions that characterize positivist methodology. | gold:	A
predicted:	D. All of these options. | gold:	D
predicted:	A. The Orient is a constructed subject that is imagined as inferior, irrational, and backward, in comparison to the West. | gold:	A
predicted:	A. Liberalism is a fundamentally pessimistic approach that regards the international system as destined to the escalation of conflict. It is the dominant conception in the practice of international politics. | gold:	C
predicted:	D. The purpose of theory is not explanation in terms of generalizable causal claims, but contextual understanding and practical knowledge. | gold:	B
predicted:	D. Offensive realism theorizes that states will pursue hegemony where possible. | gold:	C
predicted:	A. The security paradigm has been the development of multi-level analysis, to aid the understanding of disempowerment and to promote peace research involvement by NGOs, policy-makers, and the academic community. | gold:	C
predicted:	A. Analysis of environmental security is understood as the integrity of the whole ecological system whose primary threat is human activity. However, it radically challenges security thinking in that it demands a shift in the reason for action from national security interest to the welfare of the entire social-ecological system of the planet. | gold:	A
predicted:	A. Weak state insecurity in a historical framework of analysis represents an abnormal state in the long term state-building process. Bloody and violent conflict between social forces is not consistent with the presence of the centralizing force with the capacity to attain monopoly of control over violence. | gold:	C
predicted:	B. The subaltern is a term applied to a specific group of scholars from the global south. | gold:	C
predicted:	D. Gender roles are a social construct; the values that we attribute to masculinity or femininity, such as strength or care-giving, are the product of shared social ideals rather than innate biological properties. Men and women are equally able to care effectively for children or to conduct violent and aggressive behaviour. However, social constructs of gender roles are pervasive, and women are likely to be victims of gender-based violence in conflict whilst men are more likely to be involved as perpetrators of violence. | gold:	D
predicted:	C. State desire to increase wealth and prosperity. | gold:	B
predicted:	A. 1987 | gold:	C
predicted:	A. Security means freedom from war, and the ability to deter or defeat aggressive attacks. | gold:	D
predicted:	A. The West, notably Canada, Britain, and the US, have conducted research into the weaponization of Anthrax, Tularemia, Q-fever, Venezuelan equine encephalitis, and anti-agricultural agents. However biological weapons were generally viewed in the West as lacking military utility. Instead strategists have concentrated on nuclear and conventional capabilities. | gold:	D
predicted:	A and D. | gold:	C
predicted:	Coup d'état, military rebellion or mutiny; the violent intervention in politics by the state's own military forces, overthrowing and replacing the ruling elite. | gold:	B
predicted:	A, B, C, D. | gold:	B
predicted:	D. The existing mechanisms for monitoring and treating infectious disease within the international system are capable of effectively containing pandemic outbreaks. | gold:	D
predicted:	A. Although often missing from the traditional literature on war and security, women frequently serve the purposes of nationalise causes, with nationalism often presented in highly gendered and female terms, where women are symbols of statehood. | gold:	A
predicted:	D. Recent inquiry into the way in which women have been treated both in and after war has revealed a degree of ambiguity in the relationship between armed forces and civilian women. While women have often been the targets of violence by the enemy in conflict, it is also the case that they may suffer at the hands of their "protectors" which may actually undermine liberal feminists' case of the "right to fight". | gold:	A
predicted:	A. Financial policies advocated by the World Bank and IMF were readily adopted by developing countries that sought to bring their economic development into line with wealthier nations. The IFIs focus has been on achieving human security and the promotion of development at a societal level. | gold:	D
predicted:	A. When the general public is not convinced of the legitimacy of the proposed threat. | gold:	C
predicted:	D. All of these options. | gold:	A
predicted:	Adherence to liberalism does not guarantee the favoured treatment of state regimes over its citizens; other states may threaten regime security in their efforts to secure societal security. | gold:	C
predicted:	A. One of the founding assumptions of Critical Security Studies is that theories about the world constitute that world and thus that theory, including security theory, has political effects. The consequence is that theory is the product of the system, and that analyses of the agent of security and the referent object is produced by its own practices. | gold:	A
predicted:	D. HM regards the capitalist's accumulation of surplus value as a by-product of labour to be exploitation of those labourers by which the value was originally produced. | gold:	D
predicted:	A. Post-structuralism provides no basis for political action, being a dangerous mix of faux radicalism, relativism and obscurantism, whilst constructivism is an orientation to world politics rather than a specific political theory. | gold:	A
predicted:	A. An approach to security that applies critical knowledge to established orthodoxies of security studies. | gold:	A
predicted:	A process of securitization is when an issue not included in the political sphere becomes politicized and is managed within the political system. A securitized issue is part of public policy requiring governmental action; decision-making, resource allocation and even communal governance. | gold:	D
predicted:	D. A global market that has demonstrated the ability, if left unchecked, to reduce poverty and make substantial economic gains. | gold:	A
predicted:	A. Where the state employs the use of force or violence this can be regarded as an extraordinary measure. | gold:	C
predicted:	A. By articulating an issue using the language of security that issue makes the transition from the discursive political realm to the security realm. | gold:	D
predicted:	D. Despite rejecting causality, constructivists simply replace the material trigger of causality with ideas. | gold:	B
predicted:	A. A terrorist attack is that which uses the threat or use of organized violence to achieve political objectives. This may include kidnappings and organized violence for financial gain, and such attacks can be undertaken by groups or individuals. | gold:	B
predicted:	A. By regarding security as a socially constructed concept, constructivists assert that militarization is the result of governmental decisions based on shared values and cultural norms that underpin their conception of what constitutes a security risk. Accordingly, different governments will identify different threats and react in different ways. | gold:	A
predicted:	A. HM agrees with the idea that security can be viewed using a sectoral framework, and recognises the depth of analysis that is enabled by such an approach. | gold:	C
predicted:	A. Peace research was inter-disciplinary and politically orientated with immediate policy responsibility accountable to the major powers of the political system. | gold:	C
predicted:	D. States are and should remain the sole actors to be considered in the study of International Relations. | gold:	D
predicted:	The nexus between identity and security (D). | gold:	D
predicted:	A. Deterrence theory and game theory became highly influential within the academic world and gained centrality politically because the nature of the object allowed for a high degree of normative theorization which was accompanied by a mood of technological pessimism that fostered an ethos of critique. | gold:	B
predicted:	A. Human migration will arise as a result of global inequalities in the distribution of power, wealth, and resources. Disempowerment of populations will lead to competition and violence, manifested in transnational movements; and environmental threats and resources scarcity will lead to conflict. | gold:	A
predicted:	A. The Global War on Terror has had a positive effect on the state-building project. The fight against terrorism has redirected international attention and resources towards eradicating insecurities as part of the recognition of the multilevel factors facilitating the emergence of terrorism. Specifically this involves the controlling of the proliferation of arms. | gold:	B
predicted:	B. The crisis has revealed the failure of international cooperation to prevent a global catastrophe, in the form of massive economic collapse and contagion. | gold:	D
predicted:	A. The need for civilian expertise, a need driven by technological developments, resulted in a shift from targeted development of fast-changing technologies to deployment of a given technology. | gold:	C
predicted:	A. The Great Law alerts scholars to the problem of failing to sustain critique.
B. The case of the Great Law illustrates the importance of being critical of practices of research and knowledge production.
C. The Great Law is a challenge for traditional security studies, as it represents a proven non-state approach.
D. All of these. | gold:	D
predicted:	C. Despite the recognition that the ability to retaliate (the secure second-strike capability) produces a situation known as crisis stability, there is no consensus on the impact of nuclear capabilities, whether a source of stabilization or an existential threat. However there is agreement that the spread of WMD capacity to non-state actors would be fundamentally detrimental to international security based on the recognition that existing deterrence strategies and capabilities do not address the use of nuclear weapons. Indeed whilst the possibility exists, states will have to heighten security efforts. | gold:	C
predicted:	D. All of these options. | gold:	D
predicted:	A. To describe the international as hierarchically ordered and comprised of a dense set of constructed political, economic, social, military and cultural relations. | gold:	A

predicted:	D. All of these options. | gold:	D
predicted:	A. Economics as the science of individuals making decisions, and applying economic science to security, allows us to understand, predict, and respond to the behaviour of states and other security actors. | gold:	A
predicted:	A. In the post-9/11 reversion to traditional security thinking, environmental security as a concept is likely to enjoy continued attention from security analysts and policymakers. | gold:	D
predicted:	A. The 'energy security nexus' refers to the constant state of flux between energy supplies and levels of security that can be achieved by states that rely on these supplies. | gold:	C
predicted:	A and C. It has been argued that indigenous nuclear programs can make proliferation safeguards obsolete, as well as the potential for WMD to be used as political weapons. Additionally, WMD vary vastly in terms of their availability, lethality, and destructive potential and the ease with which they can be manufactured, making them a desirable political weapon. | gold:	D
predicted:	A. The international system is shaped through colonised discourse that establishes notions of certain states as inferior to others. | gold:	A
predicted:	A. From a US perspective, it is common to regard the main voice of security to be external. The question of what should or what should not count as security issues and how to conceptualize security. | gold:	C
predicted:	A. Traditional theories explain international politics as the distribution of power among members of an international system, and specifically as the balance of power amongst major states. The relative power and the constraints of a state are reflective of the security strategy of that state. | gold:	D
predicted:	D. Secession allows a societal group to withdraw from a larger entity where it may be under threat from dilution or destruction. | gold:	C
predicted:	A. If a threat posed by one group to another is military - particularly when linked to the defence of the historic homeland - armed response is required. At the intra-state level, many societal groups have no such means of armed protection and are compelled to employ non-military counter-measures. | gold:	A
predicted:	B. A wholesale shift in the way warfare is conducted and understood. | gold:	D
predicted:	A. Historical materialism as a paradigm is opposed to the broad goals of the global justice movement, which advocates an expansion of neo-liberalism in the aftermath of the global financial crisis. | gold:	D
predicted:	A. In its advocacy of global political institutions, the Treaty of Westphalia defined state sovereignty as being subjective to the behaviour of the political or ruling elite in that state, prioritizing human welfare over arbitrary values of sovereignty and thus legitimising humanitarian intervention where necessary. | gold:	D
predicted:	A and B. | gold:	D
predicted:	B. Digital information, media, and communications technology is likely to inspire greater harmony in the international system as the global population learns more about the world in which they live, and the lives of others around them. | gold:	C
predicted:	A. An increase in non-traditional security threats. | gold:	C
predicted:	C. All of these options. | gold:	B
predicted:	C. Neoliberal based adjustment policies have caused great and unnecessary hardship in developing countries and there is still no evidence they achieved their objectives for macroeconomic stability and growth. | gold:	C
predicted:	D. Aid | gold:	B
predicted:	To enable us to understand the workings of political subjecthoods left out of traditional discourses on security. | gold:	D
predicted:	D. Postcolonialism is not a predominantly or exclusively European form of knowledge. | gold:	A
predicted:	A. The Ideal Policy framework provides the analytical tools for understanding the contextual factors influencing the use of coercive diplomacy, for example why a policymaker takes the decision to, or not to, implement the Ideal Policy. | gold:	B
predicted:	A. The problematic contention that the liberalist perspective is based on ideas that are Western - such as democracy, free enterprise, and civil rights. | gold:	D
predicted:	A. Realism is a set of approaches to Security Studies that focuses on states, and tries to determine which strategy a state should adopt to achieve security and other goals. | gold:	A
predicted:	D. Pervasive violence. | gold:	D
predicted:	Critical questioning and realist logic represent a move away from traditional interpretations of security studies. | gold:	A
predicted:	A. Democratization and nationalism inhibits the opportunity for terrorism: nationalism provides the ideological dynamic to unify ethnic differences, and democracy allows for the articulation of grievances in a constructive manner. Within this analysis states with weak democratic and nationalist credentials may provide the conditions that contribute to the development of terrorism. | gold:	C
predicted:	A, B, C, D. | gold:	D
predicted:	A. The next generation is likely to develop their arguments in engagements with policy questions and in direct interaction with policymakers and think tanks. | gold:	C
predicted:	B. Environmental changes, such as rising sea levels, can threaten the land on which populations are settled as well as their access to resources. Migration as a result of these changes presents threats to societal, economic and other sectors of security. | gold:	D
predicted:	A. Empirically there is a need to understand why virtually all war and major political violence since 1945 continues to take place in the developing world and why the majority originates from internal rather than external sources. Between 20 - 30 million have lost their lives in more than one hundred intra-state wars and there are 20 - 40 wars ongoing in any given year. | gold:	D
predicted:	A. War is more likely to occur when a state is losing power, a decline in a state's ability to protect itself from attack, coercion and vulnerability increases its motivation to engage in aggressive behaviour. | gold:	D
predicted:	A. It is possible to study military security through non-realist analytical lenses, and to adopt a social constructivist approach that regards cultural and social factors as being important focuses of study. This has led to claims that broader approaches to military endeavours should be adopted, including the proposed employment of social and development specialists in conflict situations. | gold:	A
predicted:	D. Gun shows and arms fairs often do not require participants to undergo security checks before purchasing weapons, and encourage an environment where more attention is paid to price tags than details about where weapons will be distributed or used. | gold:	D
predicted:	D. Societal groups are multiple-identity units. | gold:	C
predicted:	D. To develop a new international justice system to enhance human security. | gold:	D
predicted:	A. Resilience refers to the ability of an IT system to identify and defend against a cyber-security threat. | gold:	D
predicted:	A, B, C, D. | gold:	D
predicted:	A, A fusion weapon is a three-stage-bomb that uses an implosion device to create a fission reaction, which then detonates a fusion reaction. It is often referred to as a thermo-nuclear or hydrogen device and has unlimited destructive potential. | gold:	A
predicted:	A. Materialism refers to HM's focus on class and the productive basis of societies, as well as the ways in which social structures have the capacity to change and produce change. | gold:	A
predicted:	A and D. | gold:	D
predicted:	A. There is little evidence to substantiate the claim that there is a real and increasing threat posed by the scale and scope of transnational crime in the 1980s to 1990s beyond the consensus that concern over the levels of crime were generated by the military re-conceiving its role in light of the dissolution of the Cold War. | gold:	B
predicted:	D. 2005 Marking and Tracing of Weapons Accord. | gold:	C
predicted:	A. Women did not actively engage in warfare as combatants and so questions of gender or the role of women were not important in considerations of security. | gold:	B
predicted:	D. All of these options. | gold:	D
predicted:	A. Globalization refers to the process by which shared hegemonic values pervade societies across the globe, drawing them into an ideological community, most often based on the economic principles of capitalism. | gold:	B
predicted:	A. Powerful states may employ diplomatic pressures to ensure that weak states comply with international norms. This may involve economic sanctions and withholding weaponry deals, which undermines the state's ability to pay or supply the army which increases the risk of army disaffection and possible coups. | gold:	D
predicted:	A. For societal security dilemmas ambiguity can stem from two sides of nationalism; cultural (positive) and ethnic (negative). Ethnic (political) nationalism is often described as more malign and linked to state disintegration, whereas cultural nationalism is often seen as benign, working within existing state structures. | gold:	D
predicted:	A. The security dilemma can be utilised as a force for stabilising the international environment, placing all states at equal risk of military attack and discouraging a counter-productive accumulation of military force; the impact of security dilemmas is largely restricted to the realm of military security, although this can have far-reaching effects. | gold:	B
predicted:	C. Arms control does not challenge the central role of weaponry and military power in the international system, instead focusing on the problems produced by specific weapon systems and relationships. | gold:	D
predicted:	A. Religious terrorism, B. Ideologies, C. Ethnic and Linguistic Identifications. | gold:	D
predicted:	C. Not only state actors are involved in the defence trade. Non-state actors, including illegal groups, are also key players. | gold:	C
predicted:	B. Following the popularity of HM during the Cold War it has enjoyed a gradual inclusion into security dialogue and is now considered one of the main paradigms within security studies. | gold:	C
predicted:	A. There is growing evidence of direct partnerships between terrorist groups and transnational criminal organization resulting from the end of the Cold War and the need to secure new forms of financial sponsorship. For most terrorist groups criminal activity has been amongst the most important sources of funds with the diffusion of terrorist networks globally operating in correlation to the diffusion of illicit market activities. | gold:	C
predicted:	A. Both peace researchers and realists advocated an academic focus on the escalation of the arms race. Although tensions existed between the groups in terms of their proposed solutions to this crisis, there existed a consensus that the Soviet bloc should be eliminated as a nuclear threat, thus favouring the survival of Western liberal democracies. | gold:	D
predicted:	D. By virtue of their energy resources to which the global 'North' desires access, states in the 'South' gain power in the international arena and have redressed the global North-South divide and associated inequalities. | gold:	A
predicted:	A. The end of the Cold War created the space for security policy and security studies to be re-considered in light of growing environmental consciousness underlined by multilateralism in policy action. | gold:	A
predicted:	D. HM regards class as being far more complex than a simple division between a capitalist ruling class and working class. | gold:	B
predicted:	B. Regime and international security. | gold:	D
predicted:	B. HM has some aspects in common with realism, liberalism, and social constructivism, but it offers something distinctive in having class conflict within capitalism as its central focus. | gold:	D
predicted:	A. Transnational crime developed as a result of the declining expenditure on defence and the standing down of armies, which reduced the risk of activities. | gold:	D
predicted:	C. The foundations for decisions not to allow female participation are commonly based on arbitrary and discriminatory rationale that can limit women's participation in civil society in other ways. | gold:	D
predicted:	C. The promotion of human security and the affiliated environmental security as a priority within oil-producing states. | gold:	C
predicted:	A. It is not self-evident that individuals do have universal and fundamental human rights. | gold:	D
predicted:	D. Within authoritarian and other undemocratic regimes, the relevant political decision-making is often dominated by the military and political elite. | gold:	C
predicted:	A. Security studies has always favoured a wide range of subjects when considering the field of security. Different types of security, most notably of human security and economic security, have enjoyed a great deal of attention in traditional security studies, alongside military security. After the Cold War this approach was broadened to include other types of security such as environmental and personal security. | gold:	D
predicted:	A. Liberalism poses great difficulty in defining when the use of force would be justified or necessary. | gold:	C
predicted:	D. Peace studies sought to provide a more global and non-state centric view of major issues of conflict. | gold:	C
predicted:	A. Following the expansion of peace studies in the decline of the Cold War, the field has emerged as an independent and autonomous area of study that addresses issues surrounding conflict resolution, economic security and the cessation of violence at both an international and sub-national level. As a field of research, peace studies are best defined by their distinction from development studies and international relations. | gold:	D
predicted:	C. Information plays a significant role in decision making because, although theory asserts that actors act in their own best interest, 'rational action' depends on the information available to them at the time. | gold:	C
predicted:	A, B, C and D. | gold:	B
predicted:	B. Digitalised sensitive information | gold:	B
predicted:	A. Surgical strike. | gold:	B
predicted:	D. A growth in the number and variety of weapons traded. | gold:	C
predicted:	B. Identity is of fundamental importance to the social constructivist perspective because it is the basest principle in defining behaviour; it is a naturally bestowed quality comprised of certain unalterable behavioural characteristics. | gold:	B
predicted:	A. The international system is anarchic. | gold:	D
predicted:	A. Security is a socially constructed concept, relative to the society in which it exists, and what will constitute an existential threat is accordingly subjective. | gold:	A
predicted:	B. Social dominance of men over women that results from the designation of'masculine' characteristics as more valued than 'feminine' characteristics. | gold:	B
predicted:	A. Institutional constraints limit the amount of resources to be spent on some good and force actors to choose how to manage the limited wealth available to them. | gold:	D
predicted:	D. Concern with poverty is a humanitarian issue that has no direct link to economic science, although it might be alleviated through aid. | gold:	D
predicted:	D. Humanitarian intervention prioritises the human as the referent object of security, undermining the state-centric approach of realism. | gold:	D
predicted:	A. There exists an array of contemporary challenges to energy security, ranging from resource scarcity concerns to dangers of political instability. | gold:	D
predicted:	D. The use of military force to conduct ethnic-cleansing through displacement and killing. | gold:	B
predicted:	A. Strategic studies are the central concern of international relations, within strategic studies, the subset of security studies focuses on military security. | gold:	D
predicted:	A. Mathematicians and natural scientists entered the field, which was otherwise a social-sciences area of study, adding to the interdisciplinary nature of the field. | gold:	B
predicted:	B. The favourable geo-political environment, characterized by an overwhelmingly Western military superiority and a low risk of hostile great power intervention, has generated pressures and incentives for Western policymakers to promote their policy agenda, and to manage armed conflicts from weak states and failing states. | gold:	B
predicted:	A. The securitization of environmental security concerns has raised the profile of environmental security issues among both foreign and domestic security policymakers and agencies. | gold:	C
predicted:	D. The theory of securitization lacks coherence in terms of its employment as a tool for analytical studies in security. | gold:	D
predicted:	B. In the national security approach, real threats are only those posed to human life, human rights, or human dignity. | gold:	D
predicted:	B. The end of the Cold War allowed security studies to move beyond the confines of the dominant realist and neorealist perspectives, with an emerging interest in other, non-military, conceptions of security. Those who wished to broaden the scope of security studies advocated the inclusion of resource, environment, and other referent points for analysis. | gold:	B
predicted:	D. A condition where people exist independently of state support, where human life is self-sufficient in that individuals do not require the assistance of state apparatus in order to live securely. | gold:	D
predicted:	A, B, C, D. | gold:	D
predicted:	A. Commercial liberalism is the newest and most important faction of liberalism; it advocates socialist economic principles in order to address inequalities in the distribution of wealth that threaten societal and regime security. | gold:	C
predicted:	D. All of these options. | gold:	D
predicted:	A. An abuse of this power in order to wage state-interested wars. | gold:	A
predicted:	A. The report outlined seven areas or components of human security that policymakers should henceforth devote greater political attention and capital to: economic security, food security, health security, environmental security, personal security, community security, and political security. | gold:	D
predicted:	A. Gender security is essentially an extension of the way in which we conceptualize the international political system. The analysis of gender security relations has only been made possible by the expansion of the traditional military definition of security in which national security in anarchical international society was the exclusive province of the male. | gold:	D
predicted:	A. 'A nation is secure to the extent to which it is not in danger of having to sacrifice core values if it wishes to avoid war, and is able, if challenged, to maintain them by victory in such a war.' Lippman, W. | gold:	D
predicted:	B. Ensure that the severity of cyber war as a threat is recognised, and that instances of cyber warfare are identified, publicised, and acted upon immediately. | gold:	D
predicted:	C. A change in the nature of the defence trade, linked to the changing nature of conflict. | gold:	D
predicted:	D. The notion conceptualised by the R2P approach is of a sovereignty that is intrinsically linked with responsibilities and the duty to protect the interests of citizens. | gold:	A
predicted:	A. Diplomacy cannot achieve agreements among small groups of nations where global agreements have failed. Global endorsement is required to legitimize the process, providing greater cooperation, agreements and great power backing. Failure to attain global consensus on what terrorism is will result in disparities between states' counterterrorism methods which will severely reduce the scope of employing multi-level measures in a consistent and cohesive fashion, and may afford some terrorist groups the opportunity to seek refuge in states whose domestic laws are weaker. | gold:	B
predicted:	A. To question the referent object, to question the traditional conception of military security as paramount to the state, and to change the way in which security is studied. | gold:	A
predicted:	B. Unilateral or coalitional coercive diplomacy; isolation of the adversary; clarity of objective; strength of motivation and asymmetry of motivation. | gold:	D
predicted:	B. Anarchy refers to the lack of over-arching power in the international system - there is no controlling power beyond the multiple states. In the absence of such authority, states have their own agenda for achieving security, and can determine their own goals and behaviour. | gold:	B
predicted:	D. All of these options. | gold:	D
predicted:	C. Human society is a constant and unchanging phenomenon. | gold:	C
predicted:	A. The term international regime refers to the governmental or political apparatus that defines the state within the international system. | gold:	B
predicted:	A. To achieve energy security is to ensure that there are currently sufficient energy resources to sustain the current consumption and demand for energy across the globe. | gold:	C
predicted:	A. The most important characteristics of weak states are their frequent inability to establish and maintain a monopoly of control over the instruments of violence. Even within states with well developed coercive power they do not always retain absolute loyalty and are faced with a real possibility of military intervention. Whilst armed forces are ill-equipped, poorly managed and prone to factional divisions, social actors are powerful enough to resist governance. Therefore, monopoly over the instruments of violence is infrequent. | gold:	A
predicted:	A. Security studies theory refers to the historical systematic distinction between strategic studies and security studies and the interrelation between general International Relations (IR) theory, security studies, and security theory. | gold:	C
predicted:	B. Human rights orientated liberalism will advocate separatism where conflict and bloodshed seem inevitable without it. | gold:	D
predicted:	A. Hierarchical forms of transnational criminal activity are primarily territorially affiliated to a particular state / ethnic-cultural group and have limited transnational potential. | gold:	D
predicted:	B. The concept of human security gained increasing currency in the mid-1990s, serving to highlight critical issues. In particular, the study of human society has focuses on the problem of intra-state violence, which has become the dominant issue for post-Cold War security studies. | gold:	C
predicted:	A and D. Governments should include in their arms trade rules, laws, penalties for their violation, and ensure that weapons producers mark their defence items with a unique marking. Additionally, government police and military forces should establish appropriate weapons stockpile security measures and national authorities should collect and destroy old, outdated, and excess weaponry. | gold:	D
predicted:	A. The coercer must not unduly threaten the adversary; threat must be credible; adversary must recognise the legitimacy of coercer's demands; coercer must assure adversary that compliance will not lead to future demands; conflict must not be perceived as a zero-sum game. | gold:	B
predicted:	A. Category B agents are those that present little to no risk or morbidity within infected populations, but can have detrimental effects on the ability of a group to perform physical tasks. | gold:	C
predicted:	A. 1970s | gold:	A
predicted:	D. A critical approach would recognise the changing ontology of security in the real world. Such changes are evident in the new ways in which war has been conducted in the 20th and 21st century. | gold:	B
predicted:	B. A culture characterized by rivalry, which has dominated since the beginning of the modern system of states and in which actors regard each other as rivals but exercise some restraint in violence. | gold:	B
predicted:	A. Woman as 'victim' is, and continues to be, an important narrative of war stories. In 1990 an estimated 90% of war casualties were civilian, the majority women and children. Reports that women are the primary casualties of war has contributed to the enduring perception that women are dependent on men for protection, and that men are responsible for sacrificing their own well bring for the protection of women and the state (often confused with one another through propaganda and imagery). | gold:	A
predicted:	A. Women and children are dependent on the state for protection and Security Studies should include them and account for their needs. | gold:	D
predicted:	D. All of these options. | gold:	D
predicted:	D. Although demand from developing states is set to increase the global consumption of dwindling energy resources, technological advancements in alternative energy sources, coupled with comprehensive understanding of current resource levels and access, will secure energy supply in the foreseeable future. | gold:	C
predicted:	D. Objective security: when a matter is objectively considered a security issue, regardless of interpretation. | gold:	D
predicted:	A. An increasingly popular means of bolstering regime security has been the expulsion of foreign workers and non-ethnic nationals and restricting borders to refugees and migrants. | gold:	C
predicted:	A. Technological advancements have to some extent rendered the battlefield gender-neutral. 'Virtual' warfare has resolved the historical tension between the citizen and the state security apparatus; if actual combat could be avoided then male and female soldiers could wage war on equal terms. However, technological advancement remains unequal and so the gender situation is different in different contexts, depending on development and security issues. | gold:	A
predicted:	C. Illegal trading by states is the primary way in which weapons purchased legally might end up on the illegal arms market. | gold:	D
predicted:	A. Human security has put particular emphasis on the nexus between conflict and development, a concept which is very useful. The significance of the nexus between development and conflict is not just that it raises ethical issues about human suffering and inequalities, but that its frequent outcomes, so called state future, has dire local, regional, and global effects. | gold:	D
predicted:	D. Critical Security studies questions the epistemological principles of other approaches in Security Studies. | gold:	A
predicted:	A. Military warfare enhances the ability of people's access to resources and to aid the development in ecologically sustainable ways; it can secure access routes and rights that would otherwise be denied; rebuild infrastructure and equitable access of resources; benefit the management of environmental problems; and also to bolster social institutions and cohesion. | gold:	B
predicted:	Withdrawal of economic trade rights with the domestic market. | gold:	A
predicted:	A. Market place scholars argue that transnational crime operates like a capitalist marketplace in its scope and extensity of operations. Criminal organizations are thus very resilient to law enforcement efforts by virtue of their sheer size. Of comparative difference is the development of highly sophisticated networks of collaboration between criminal groups that has enabled them to survive under the conditions of the competitive logic of the marketplace. | gold:	D
predicted:	A. Within the context of state collapse, elites deliberately engender disorder for the pursuit of commercial activities and the exploitation of neo-liberal globalized shadow markets which would not otherwise be permissible in normal conditions. Warlord politics represented a new form of regime security forced upon weak state elites. | gold:	A
predicted:	A, B, C, D. | gold:	D
predicted:	War is best regarded as a rational instrument of political policy; it is a continuation of politics by other means. | gold:	A
predicted:	D. All of these options. | gold:	A
predicted:	A. Isolation of the effect that the threat of force or the limited use of force, in a given case is dependent on the sufficiency of the "stick" for success. The question to ask is whether the stick employed was sufficient to produce compliance. | gold:	D
predicted:	A. Environmental security entails a consideration of the security of the global environment, as well as its nested sub-systems and social systems beyond the boundaries of the nation state. | gold:	D
predicted:	A. Liberalism holds that international organisations can enhance national and international security. It advocates the inclusion of non-governmental organisations and other actors to encourage cooperation and build communities. | gold:	A
predicted:	B. Culture is the product of shared identity and interaction, although it is important in understanding the dynamics of social identity, its wider reference to security studies is largely disputed. | gold:	D
predicted:	D. All of these options. | gold:	D
predicted:	A. The global political arena is dominated by a paradigm of human-security which promotes human security based on core assumptions of what it is to be secure, and which transcend cultural or political diversity. | gold:	C
predicted:	B and C. | gold:	C
predicted:	A. Military professionals believe that the majority of biological agents can be sufficiently stable in their effects to be used as a weapon. Resource requirements would be minimal as fermenters used to make vaccines could be converted for military production and relatively small quantities of the agent are required to produce highly lethal effects, making them an efficient and effective weapon. | gold:	C
predicted:	B. Whilst Critical Security Studies regards security to be a social construction, based on the changeable ideas that form human society, the Copenhagen school disregards this epistemological approach and instead considers security as an issue to be studied objectively from a positivist approach. | gold:	A
predicted:	A. Fission nuclear weapons are gun-type devices that require a relatively small amount of fissile uranium-235 material to produce a comparatively large explosion because mass and energy becomes interchangeable in the barrel. Implosion devices however are unable to sustain the reaction; the neutron generator is unable to set off the interchange being destroyed in the explosion. | gold:	D
predicted:	HIV/AIDS is considered to be a non-traditional security issue because it has the potential to cause instability and insecurity through its impact on human health, which can in turn undermine the state and its ability to provide essential services. Additionally, HIV/AIDS can have a spill-over effect into other regions, leading to cross-border instability. Furthermore, the overwhelming scale of HIV/AIDS means that it cannot be ignored and requires a new approach to theorize its impact on security. Therefore, HIV/AIDS is best defined as a non-traditional security issue. | gold:	B
predicted:	C. To prevent the securitization of irrelevant threats and to challenge the legitimacy of currently securitized threats. | gold:	A
predicted:	A. The term'medicalization' refers to the process whereby a medical or health issue becomes securitized. | gold:	D
predicted:	A. Health has long been regarded as a security issue. During the 20th century there was an increasingly sense of panic about the potential damage of a serious pandemic disease outbreak in the newly globalised world. Medical advances and a series of successful contained outbreaks have largely allayed these fears. | gold:	D
predicted:	A. Peace studies developed after the Second World War as a response to the failure of International Relations to prevent global conflict following World War I. Initially, the field was conditioned by the nuclear arms race and East-West divide that characterised the Cold War, but was quick to embrace environmental concerns and the issues surrounding the North-South wealth/poverty divide. | gold:	A
predicted:	A. Securitizing injects urgency into an issue and leads to a sustained mobilization of political support and deployment of resources. | gold:	D
predicted:	A. Societies are threatened when their linguistic heritage and traditions are under attack. The inability to use and develop traditional language signifies the destruction of a society. | gold:	B
predicted:	A. An actor can have only one social identity, and this forms the basis for developing other identities. In contrast, an actor may have multiple corporate identities which vary in importance. | gold:	B
predicted:	A. Environmental change can be a cause of war between countries, largely centred on resource scarcity interrelated with conflict. There is therefore a strong connection between environmental degradation and violence; resources as strategic goals and strategic tools may cause violence if there is inequity. | gold:	D
predicted:	D. The IT system has failed due to a random unexpected event, such as a tsunami which destroys key electronic equipment. | gold:	B
predicted:	D. All of these options. | gold:	D
predicted:	A. The inability of the state to provide stability creates a situation wherein each component of society competes to preserve its well-being thereby engendering insecurity. The condition is self-perpetuating - a semi-permanent situation of emergent anarchy because measures to secure the regime will provoke greater resistance. | gold:	A
predicted:	B. Normative or ideational structures are important and matter as much as, if not more than, material structures. | gold:	C
predicted:	C. Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels. | gold:	C
predicted:	A. Elites create negative inducements for non support of the regime. Redistribution as a means of denial to the power structure in the form of "elite disenfranchisement" which may include diversion of resources, disarmament and denial of access to commercial activity routes. | gold:	B
predicted:	B. Yes, successful policies of arms control and deterrence have translated well from other security realms, such as nuclear weapons control strategies. | gold:	C
predicted:	D. All of these options. Responses to terrorist attacks vary either explicitly or implicitly, if warfare is seen as warfare, crime, or disease. | gold:	D
predicted:	D. All of these options. | gold:	D
predicted:	A and D. | gold:	D
predicted:	C. Non-governmental groups have played a significant and effective role in developing arms control measures in recent years. | gold:	C
predicted:	B. The responsibility to prevent. | gold:	B
predicted:	A. The term development refers to the human condition in which there is freedom from fear and want; there are sufficient resources to sustain life and this life can exist in a state free from the threat, or perceived threat, of sudden interruption. | gold:	C
predicted:	A. Eurocentrism is a style of analysis in which European societies are compared to non-European societies to produce an unbiased comparison of the relative merits of each. | gold:	B
predicted:	A. Any crime that uses computers to jeopardise or attempt to jeopardise national security. | gold:	D
predicted:	A. Human security is threatened by global inequality, because 3s of the world population do not share the benefits of globalisation. However, this inequality does not translate into political instability or involve military action. | gold:	C
predicted:	A. The viability of the CWC and BCW providing a concrete basis in international law to prevent the proliferation of chemical and biological weapons is dubious. The Proliferation Security Initiative to prevent the illicit trade in materials relating to chemical and nuclear weapons is an equally piecemeal pursuit. Whilst they may serve some utility as a framework for diplomatic exchanges, they are essentially toothless bodies lacking the political will to establish an authority with the powers to police the control and use of these weapons. | gold:	D
predicted:	A. Social constructivism employs theories of causality in the study of international relations, in addition to prioritising the study of identity as a socially constructed theory. In contrast, realism regards state of actor behaviour in the international system to follow an 'action-response' pattern. | gold:	C
predicted:	A. A virus or worm. | gold:	C
predicted:	D. Security studies creates and perpetuates claims that shape warfare, defining legitimacy, favouring some subjects and marginalising others. | gold:	D
predicted:	A and B. | gold:	D
predicted:	D. Nations are defined by the boundaries and borders of the state. | gold:	C
predicted:	C. Feminist and critical security theory shows us that war can have gendered consequences. Recognition of those consequences has allowed us to address the way in which we think about'male' and 'female' expectations in warfare, and has shaped the way in which we theorise, participate, and protest against those roles. | gold:	C
predicted:	A. Prevention is normally associated with the concept of terrorism as war or crime. All governments will practice prevention (seen as repression from the terrorist perspective) by seeking to arrest or eliminate those actively involved in the violence. Security forces attack the terrorists before they strike (war) or they are arrested after the attack (crime). | gold:	A
predicted:	The distinction between limited force and full-scale force is the second process of coercive diplomacy. Coercive diplomacy only fails if the coercer fails to achieve its defined goals and fails to defeat its adversary in the second stage. | gold:	D
predicted:	A, B, C and D. The most obvious issue of joint concern during the 2000s was terror and order, although fast-rising concerns over environmental/climate security could easily provide another big linking issue. The fate of security studies depends on its ability to prevail in the general debates in the discipline of IR. It is very unlikely that the internal dynamics of the theory debate will be decided by a general prevalence of one of the current debates. Both the US and European analysts will be working on the role and nature of technology, globalization, risk society and the international economic order. This picture shows that there will be a lot of points of contact between the currently disconnected fields of theory. | gold:	D
predicted:	B. Institutional constraints and resource constraints (Answer) | gold:	D
predicted:	B. The state and state apparatus. | gold:	A
predicted:	A, B, D. Coercive diplomacy is hard because it relies heavily on perceptual, psychological and emotional factors, which can be difficult to control and manipulate. Additionally, the risk of misperception and miscalculation can lead to failure, as seen in the Cuban Missile Crisis. Furthermore, offering inducements can be difficult as it can appear to be concessionary politics and can blur the line of what constitutes a successful coercive diplomacy. | gold:	C
