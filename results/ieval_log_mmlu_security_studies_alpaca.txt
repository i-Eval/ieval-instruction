predicted:	D. The responsibility to rebuild. | gold:	C
predicted:	C. The environmental problems encountered by countries are principally internal. External threats remain within a country's control: external military threats will remain unchanged and a primary concern. | gold:	B
predicted:	A. The global economy is interconnected, ensuring that energy security for one is dependent upon energy security for all. Thus all core powers have the same interests in maintaining and extending the conditions under which this market operates. As long as this economic order exists, conflict between major powers over energy reserves is highly unlikely. | gold:	A
predicted:	D. All of these options. | gold:	D
predicted:	A. State responses to transnational crime have evolved in correlation to the increased threat posed to the integrity of the state. Organized crime has been regarded primarily as a national security threat to be addressed domestically. The institutionalized international approaches for information sharing have been predominately bilateral to the extent of bringing to justice perpetrators of crime that are seeking to evade justice. | gold:	B
predicted:	A. The main disciplinary context for security studies theorizing was a move away from the disciplinary domination of political science towards multi-academe interaction from sociology, mathematics, psychology, natural and political sciences, and economics. | gold:	C
predicted:	A. Fiscal Discipline: budget deficits of no more than 2 per cent of gross domestic product (GDP). | gold:	D
predicted:	C. Anti-virus industry. | gold:	A

predicted:	Conventional constructivists view constructivism as a bridge between rationalist and reflectivist approaches, enabling both to benefit from the insights of the other. Critical constructivists argue that this approach simply reproduces the binary distinctions that characterize positivist methodology. Social constructivists, however, regard this as an unhelpful regression to positivist binary frameworks of analysis. | gold:	A
predicted:	A. There is no direct return on investment in building security systems. | gold:	D
predicted:	A. The Orient is a constructed subject that is imagined as inferior, irrational, and backward, in comparison to the West. | gold:	A
predicted:	A. Liberalism is a fundamentally pessimistic approach that regards the international system as destined to the escalation of conflict. It is the dominant conception in the practice of international politics. | gold:	C
predicted:	D. The purpose of theory is not explanation in terms of generalizable causal claims, but contextual understanding and practical knowledge. | gold:	B
predicted:	C. Both defensive realism and offensive realism regard power and competition as a means by which security can be achieved for the state. | gold:	C
predicted:	A. The security paradigm has been the development of multi-level analysis, to aid the understanding of disempowerment and to promote peace research involvement by NGOs, policy-makers, and the academic community. | gold:	C
predicted:	A. Environmental security contends that the primary threat to the ecological integrity is human activity. This implies that humans are the cause of potential environmental harm and therefore must be targeted for their own welfare. This is unlike traditional security thinking which views humans as the source of security, rather than the cause of potential insecurity. | gold:	A
predicted:	A. Weak state insecurity can be explained by the lack of centralization of power, which allows various social forces to operate independently of the state, leading to a weakening of the state's ability to monopolize violence. | gold:	C

predicted:	A. The West, notably Canada, Britain, and the US, have conducted research into the weaponization of Anthrax, Tularemia, Q-fever, Venezuelan equine encephalitis, and anti-agricultural agents. However biological weapons were generally viewed in the West as lacking military utility. Instead strategists have concentrated on nuclear and conventional capabilities. | gold:	D
predicted:	Answer: D. Mothers are indispensable to the exercise of military power but often overlooked in traditional security analyses. | gold:	C
predicted:	C. Coup d'Ã©tat, military rebellion or mutiny; the violent intervention in politics by the state's own military forces, overthrowing and replacing the ruling elite. | gold:	B
predicted:	A. Organized transnational crime groups are those structured groups randomly formed or otherwise but do not have a formally defined role for its members or continuity of membership but have a developed purpose for the intent of committing crimes. | gold:	B
predicted:	C. Like terrorism, pandemics present a set of threats and risks that are diverse yet interconnected. | gold:	D
predicted:	C. Measures of national pride and success are biased towards the glorification of female attributes such as the ability to bear children. The restriction of women to the domestic sphere creates a sense of national identity that is founded on a celebration of home life, feminine strength, and maternal characteristics. | gold:	A
predicted:	C. | gold:	A
predicted:	The World Bank and International Monetary Fund have provided financial assistance and technical assistance to countries worldwide to help them address their economic problems. They provide loans and grants to countries to help them build capacity and create jobs. They also provide advice on economic policies, budgeting, and financial management. They believe that their assistance is essential for countries to achieve sustainable economic growth and to lift their citizens out of poverty. | gold:	D
predicted:	When may an issue fail to become securitized? 
A. When the general public is not convinced of the legitimacy of the proposed threat. 
B. When, following the discursive element of the process, extraordinary measures are not implemented. 
C. When the securitizing actor is not granted the special right to implement extraordinary measure.
D. When the audience are convinced via the speech act or the securitizing actor but fail to grant that actor the special rights requested in order to address the proposed threat. | gold:	C
predicted:	D. All of these options. | gold:	A
predicted:	D. Adherence to liberalism does not guarantee the favoured treatment of state regimes over its citizens; other states may threaten regime security in their efforts to secure societal security. | gold:	C
predicted:	C. Post-structuralism is critical of the notion of objective knowledge and seeks to highlight the subjective nature of knowledge claims. It argues that knowledge is constructed and not simply inherited, and that our understanding of the world is based on our own subjective beliefs and experiences, which can be open to challenge and criticism. | gold:	A
predicted:	A. | gold:	D
predicted:	A. Post-structuralism provides no basis for political action, being a dangerous mix of faux radicalism, relativism and obscurantism, whilst constructivism is an orientation to world politics rather than a specific political theory. | gold:	A
predicted:	C. A study of security that focuses on the state, military and traditional security measures. | gold:	A
predicted:	A securitizing actor can argue for an issue to be securitized when it is outside of the political domain. An existential threat can be made a matter for state attention even when it is not included within public debate. Securitization refers to the recognition of the threat prior to its emergence in the political process. | gold:	D
predicted:	C. The sharing of ideas, technologies and resources that can benefit human security, such as medical advancements. | gold:	A
predicted:	A. Where the state employs the use of force or violence this can be regarded as an extraordinary measure. | gold:	C
predicted:	A. By articulating an issue using the language of security that issue makes the transition from the discursive political realm to the security realm. | gold:	D
predicted:	C. By regarding the state as the most important actor, constructivism neglects internationalization in a globalized world. | gold:	B
predicted:	A. A terrorist attack is that which uses the threat or use of organized violence to achieve political objectives. This may include kidnappings and organized violence for financial gain, and such attacks can be undertaken by groups or individuals. | gold:	B
predicted:	A. By regarding security as a socially constructed concept, constructivists assert that militarization is the result of governmental decisions based on shared values and cultural norms that underpin their conception of what constitutes a security risk. Accordingly, different governments will identify different threats and react in different ways. | gold:	A
predicted:	A. HM agrees with the idea that security can be viewed using a sectoral framework, and recognises the depth of analysis that is enabled by such an approach. | gold:	C
predicted:	A. Peace research was inter-disciplinary and politically orientated with immediate policy responsibility accountable to the major powers of the political system. | gold:	C
predicted:	C. Nation states are not basically alike. | gold:	D
predicted:	A. The nexus between identity and security. | gold:	D
predicted:	A. Deterrence theory and game theory became highly influential within the academic world and gained centrality politically because the nature of the object allowed for a high degree of normative theorization which was accompanied by a mood of technological pessimism that fostered an ethos of critique. | gold:	B
predicted:	A. Human migration will be a major cause of developing conflicts in the twenty-first century as people will seek to move to areas where they feel they can find greater economic and social opportunities. This has already caused tensions between nations and will lead to further competition and violence, manifested in transnational movements. Additionally, environmental threats and resources scarcity will lead to conflict, as people are forced to compete for limited resources and are not able to resolve their disputes through dialogue. 
B. Economic interdependency between states will strengthen global security and lead to a reduction in international conflict. This is particularly true when economic interests are integrated with security interests, creating incentives for states to resolve disputes through negotiation and compromise.
C. The primary cause of conflict, both at international and sub-national level will be based in ideological differences between populations as resources scarcity, population growth and human migration forces diverse identity groups into increasingly close contact. This will lead to more competition and violence, creating a greater need for international organizations to develop policies that can manage these disputes. 
D. Environmental concerns will be overshadowed by immediate threats to international security, posed by global economic crisis and the subsequent rise of fundamentalist ideologies and violence. Human migration will be managed within the current global economic system as poverty restricts movement, although there is a limited risk of transnational revolt as a result of disempowerment and resource scarcity.

The potential consequences of climate change include: decreased air quality, water scarcity, extreme weather events, displacement of people, loss of biodiversity, and an increased risk of infectious diseases. | gold:	A
predicted:	A. The Global War on Terror has had a positive effect on the state-building project. The fight against terrorism has redirected international attention and resources towards eradicating insecurities as part of the recognition of the multilevel factors facilitating the emergence of terrorism. Specifically this involves the controlling of the proliferation of arms. | gold:	B

predicted:	A. The Great Law alerts scholars to the problem of failing to sustain critique. | gold:	D
predicted:	C. Despite the recognition that the ability to retaliate (the secure second-strike capability) produces a situation known as crisis stability, there is no consensus on the impact of nuclear capabilities, whether a source of stabilization or an existential threat. However, there is agreement that the spread of WMD capacity to non-state actors would be fundamentally detrimental to international security. | gold:	C
predicted:	The Ideal Policy framework states that a coercer must have the will and capability to back up their threats with military power, as well as the ability to offer assurance that they will not be defeated. It is clear that the adversary believes that the coercer is bluffing, and that their threats are not backed by the capability to follow through. This is likely to result in increased aggression and non-compliance, since the adversary believes they are not in danger of being defeated. To make the threat credible, the coercer must have the capability to swiftly defeat the adversary and must be willing to do so if needed. This will help to ensure that the adversary complies and does not underestimate the coercer's capabilities. | gold:	D
predicted:	Postcolonial analysis uses the term 'thick space' to describe the international as a site of power struggles, where the powerful use various methods to shape and control the lives of those within and outside of the international system. The term 'thick space' is used to describe the layered and complex nature of the international and how those within it interact with one another. | gold:	A

predicted:	A. The 'energy security nexus' refers to the constant state of flux between energy supply and levels of security. | gold:	C
predicted:	A. WMD can provide the ability to project power and influence internationally, as well as deter potential adversaries. The threat of possessing WMD may be enough to discourage potential aggressors from engaging in hostilities, or to ensure that their aggression is repelled if it is initiated. WMD can also provide the capability to retaliate after an attack, ensuring that the aggressor will suffer greatly in the event of any hostilities. Additionally, the mere possession of WMD may make it difficult for a state to be attacked, as any potential attacker will fear the consequences of engaging in hostilities with a state that has WMD. | gold:	D
predicted:	A. The international system is shaped through colonised discourse that establishes notions of certain states as inferior to others. | gold:	A
predicted:	The main difference between theorizing on security from an American and European perspective is that Americans tend to focus on external threats and use hard power solutions, while Europeans tend to focus on internal threats and use soft power solutions. Americans view security as a problem-solving endeavor, while Europeans view it as a cognitive endeavor. Americans believe that security is a technical problem, whereas Europeans believe that it is a sociological problem. | gold:	C
predicted:	A. Traditional theories explain international politics as the balance of power amongst members of an international system, and specifically as the distribution of power amongst major states. The relative power and the constraints of a state are reflective of the security strategy of that state. | gold:	D
predicted:	D. Secession. | gold:	C
predicted:	A. If a threat posed by one group to another is military - particularly when linked to the defence of the historic homeland - armed response is required. At the intra-state level, many societal groups have no such means of armed protection and are compelled to employ non-military counter-measures. | gold:	A
predicted:	B. A wholesale shift in the way warfare is conducted and understood. | gold:	D
predicted:	A. Historical materialism as a paradigm is opposed to the broad goals of the global justice movement, which advocates an expansion of neo-liberalism in the aftermath of the global financial crisis. | gold:	D
predicted:	C. State sovereignty and principles of non-interference that underpin the Westphalian approach can be disregarded, provided that there is a consensus amongst international actors that human life within the state is at risk, and where that risk is from the actions of the state itself. This is the argument put forward by humanitarian interventionists, who believe that the international community should be willing to intervene in states' affairs when the state itself is not willing or capable of protecting its citizens. The key here is that the intervention must be authorized by the international community, most likely through the UN Security Council. | gold:	D
predicted:	A) has been the most common answer. It is easier for criminals to move illicit profits and illegal goods, provide services, and smuggle persons across borders. | gold:	D

predicted:	A. Empirically there is a need to understand why virtually all war and major political violence since 1945 continues to take place in the developing world and why the majority originates from internal rather than external sources. 
B. Conceptually there is a need to find appropriate theories and concepts that accommodate the unique character of the security situation in the developing world; intra-state war, communal violence, poverty, famine, weapons proliferation, crime, and political instability, socio-economic breakdown and state collapse.
C. From a normative perspective there are clear humanitarian imperatives to resolve the lack of security; 90 per cent of victims of intra-state violence are civilians, half a million are killed by light weapons, 40,000 a year die from hunger and poverty whilst tens of millions die from disease, chronic poverty, and inadequate health, education, employment, and environmental causes.
D. All of these options. There is a profound disjuncture between security in developed nations and the kind of security in the world's "zones of instability". From a global perspective insecurity is more of a norm than security is. However, globalization essentially means that these forms of insecurity cannot be contained within increasingly porous national borders. | gold:	D
predicted:	A. War is more likely to occur when a state is losing power, a decline in a state's ability to protect itself from attack, coercion and vulnerability increases its motivation to engage in aggressive behaviour. | gold:	D
predicted:	A. It is possible to study military security through non-realist analytical lenses, and to adopt a social constructivist approach that regards cultural and social factors as being important focuses of study. This has led to claims that broader approaches to military endeavours should be adopted, including the proposed employment of social and development specialists in conflict situations. | gold:	A

predicted:	Resilience in an IT system is its ability to remain and operate secure even in the presence of cyber-security threats. It is important because it ensures that the system can remain secure and continue to provide services even if it is under attack. This is critical to the system's survival and the safety of its data. | gold:	D
predicted:	 All of the above are correct. | gold:	D
predicted:	A fusion device is different from a fission device in that it does not undergo a chain reaction like a fission device. Fission devices use a chain reaction to release energy, while fusion devices use a convergent, inward-focused approach to release energy. Fission devices use an arrangement of neutrons to create more neutrons, while fusion devices use the release of energy from two lighter elements fusing to create a heavier element. Fission devices can be used to create a nuclear explosion, while fusion devices can be used to create a more powerful, clean, energy-generating fireball. Fission devices are more efficient than fusion devices, but they require a much larger device in order to create the same amount of energy. Fusion devices, on the other hand, have the potential to create much more energy from the same size device. Fission devices are more powerful than fusion devices, but they require a much larger device in order to create the same amount of energy. Fusion devices have the potential to create much more energy from the same size device. | gold:	A

predicted:	C. The role of women was given appropriate consideration; women have fulfilled many vital roles in the support of the dominant security system. | gold:	B
predicted:	A. Realist opposition to humanitarian intervention is based on the idea that states should be able to determine the fate of their own citizens without external interference. This is seen as a violation of sovereignty and can lead to a lack of trust in the international system. | gold:	D
predicted:	B. Best described as intensification of worldwide social relations and increasing interdependence, globalization is the result of the compression of space and time through the development of new technologies. | gold:	B
predicted:	A. Powerful states may employ diplomatic pressures to ensure that weak states comply with international norms. This may involve economic sanctions and withholding weaponry deals, which undermines the state's ability to pay or supply the army which increases the risk of army disaffection and possible coups. | gold:	D
predicted:	A. Ethnic (political) nationalism is often seen as more malign and linked to state disintegration, whereas cultural (positive) nationalism is often seen as benign, working within existing state structures. | gold:	D
predicted:	A security dilemma is a situation in which a state's efforts to gain security through its own military forces also creates a threat to the security of other states. It occurs when a state's military forces are not large enough to deter aggression, yet are too strong to be attacked. This creates a difficult situation in which a state must choose between two undesirable options - either be vulnerable to attack or appear to be so strong that it could initiate aggression. This security dilemma is one of the main causes of conflict in the international system and is a key concept in the study of international security. | gold:	B
predicted:	C. Arms control does not challenge the central role of weaponry and military power in the international system, instead focusing on the problems produced by specific weapon systems and relationships. | gold:	D
predicted:	Correct. Religious terrorism is a form of terrorism that is motivated by religious beliefs and ideologies. It is not limited to al-Qaeda, and has been used to justify ethnic cleansing and anti-abortionist assassinations. Christian beliefs were used to justify the ethnic cleansing in Bosnia, as well as anti-abortionist assassinations in the USA. | gold:	D

predicted:	HM has been developed and studied more and more in security studies since the Cold War. It has been incorporated into the broader security dialogue and is now an accepted and respected paradigm within security studies. Its popularity has grown exponentially, with many security experts turning to HM for guidance and insight. It has become an essential tool for understanding and addressing security issues. | gold:	C
predicted:	A. There is growing evidence of direct partnerships between terrorist groups and transnational criminal organization resulting from the end of the Cold War and the need to secure new forms of financial sponsorship. For most terrorist groups criminal activity has been amongst the most important sources of funds with the diffusion of terrorist networks globally operating in correlation to the diffusion of illicit market activities. | gold:	C
predicted:	A. Both peace researchers and realists advocated an academic focus on the escalation of the arms race. Although tensions existed between the groups in terms of their proposed solutions to this crisis, there existed a consensus that the Soviet bloc should be eliminated as a nuclear threat, thus favouring the survival of Western liberal democracies. | gold:	D
predicted:	C. United by common insecurities concerning the production and supply of energy resources, international actors are forced into negotiation and cooperation between states increases. | gold:	A

predicted:	C. By the 1970s, prominent peace researchers were calling for a broadening in the remit of the field but were largely unsuccessful in their attempts. | gold:	C
predicted:	A. Following the expansion of peace studies in the decline of the Cold War, the field has emerged as an independent and autonomous area of study that addresses issues surrounding conflict resolution, economic security and the cessation of violence at both an international and sub-national level. As a field of research, peace studies are best defined by their distinction from development studies and international relations. | gold:	D
predicted:	A. Information is not important to decision making in economic theory; rather, it is an actor's perceptions of situations that will inform their decision making process. | gold:	C
predicted:	A. HM pays insufficient attention to the role of the labourer, instead focusing on the capitalist as the source of power and most important actor. HM can also allude to capitalist power structures, to the detriment of supporting the human security of workers. | gold:	B

predicted:	A. Coercive diplomacy has proven a successful policy tool and one that is integral to conflict management. The successes of the past policy initiatives in the post-9/11 community have reinforced the trend toward coercive diplomacy by increasing American political will to counter mass casualty terrorism in failing states. | gold:	B
predicted:	A. The securitization of environmental security concerns has raised the profile of environmental security among both foreign and domestic security policymakers and agencies. It is now uniformly recognized that environmental change can be considered an issue of high security politics. | gold:	C

predicted:	A. A nuclear blast produces EMP, a thermal light pulse, blast, and fallout at the moment of detonation. The electro-magnetic pulse occurs when gamma radiation interacts with matter (the atmosphere), "the Compton effect." EMP produces a high voltage charge, harmless to humans but destructive to electronic systems. EMP effects are maximized at high altitude. However thermal-light pulse can produce flash blindness, retinal burn, and fire whilst the airburst can cause severe skin burn. | gold:	D
predicted:	A. Commercial liberalism is the newest and most important faction of liberalism; it advocates socialist economic principles in order to address inequalities in the distribution of wealth that threaten societal and regime security. | gold:	C
predicted:	A. Security studies emerged in relation to the interests of the USA and Britain following the Second World War. | gold:	D
predicted:	C. Whilst some states have proven their ability to conduct 'just' wars in order to protect sound values of democracy and neoliberalism, not all states would use force to pursue such globally beneficial ends. | gold:	A
predicted:	The Human Development Report, published by the United Nations Development Program in 1994, challenged the traditional security paradigm by advocating for a comprehensive approach to human security that emphasizes the interconnectedness of all aspects of life. The report highlighted the economic, social, and political dimensions of security, and stressed the need to prioritize the well-being of individuals, communities, and societies as a whole. It also pointed out that traditional security strategies have failed to keep up with the realities of the modern world, and called for a security approach that is more in tune with the needs of the 21st century. | gold:	D
predicted:	Gender security is the study of the impact of gender on security policies and practices. It examines the ways in which gender affects the security of individuals, societies, and states, as well as the implications of gender inequality and discrimination on security. It is an interdisciplinary field of study which can incorporate elements of economics, politics, sociology, and international relations. | gold:	D
predicted:	C. 'Emancipation is the freeing of people (as individuals and groups) from the physical and human constraints which stop them carrying out what they would freely choose to do... Security and emancipation are two sides of the same coin. Emancipation, not power or order, produces true security. Emancipation, theoretically, is security.' Booth, K. | gold:	D

predicted:	A. Diplomacy cannot achieve agreements among small groups of nations where global agreements have failed. Global endorsement is required to legitimize the process, providing greater cooperation, agreements and great power backing. Failure to attain global consensus on what terrorism is will result in disparities between states' counterterrorism methods which will severely reduce the scope of employing multi-level measures in a consistent and cohesive fashion, and may afford some terrorist groups the opportunity to seek refuge in states whose domestic laws are weaker. | gold:	B

predicted:	A. | gold:	A
predicted:	A. Security studies theory refers to the historical systematic distinction between strategic studies and security studies and the interrelation between general International Relations (IR) theory, security studies, and security theory. | gold:	C
predicted:	A. Modern human rights oriented liberalism is concerned with self-determination. | gold:	D
predicted:	A. Hierarchical forms of transnational criminal activity are primarily territorially affiliated to a particular state / ethnic-cultural group and have limited transnational potential. | gold:	D
predicted:	A. Human security as a concept has struggled to gain recognition amongst scholars of security studies, or in the policy-making community. | gold:	C
predicted:	A. Governments should include in their arms trade rules, laws, penalties for their violation. | gold:	D
predicted:	A. | gold:	B
predicted:	A. Category B agents are those that present little to no risk or morbidity within infected populations, but can have detrimental effects on the ability of a group to perform physical tasks. | gold:	C
predicted:	The cyber-security discourse emerged in the 1990s. | gold:	A
predicted:	C. By implementing a critical analysis we can recognise that traditional conceptions of military security are no longer always salient and may need to be reconsidered. | gold:	B
predicted:	B. A culture characterized by rivalry, which has dominated since the beginning of the modern system of states and in which actors regard each other as rivals but exercise some restraint in violence. | gold:	B
predicted:	A. Woman as 'victim' is, and continues to be, an important narrative of war stories. | gold:	A
predicted:	A. Women and children are dependent on the state for protection and Security Studies should include them and account for their needs. | gold:	D
predicted:	A. As a means of exerting economic power to advance peace and freedom. | gold:	D
predicted:	A. Whilst energy consumption is correlated to levels of industrialisation, developed states of the North continue to increase their demand for energy. This is balanced by a lesser demand from states in the South; due to their lack of industrialisation their demands on energy are forecast to remain low. | gold:	C
predicted:	D. Objective security. | gold:	D
predicted:	A. An increasingly popular means of bolstering regime security has been the expulsion of foreign workers and non-ethnic nationals and restricting borders to refugees and migrants. | gold:	C
predicted:	A. Technological advancements have to some extent rendered the battlefield gender-neutral. 'Virtual' warfare has resolved the historical tension between the citizen and the state security apparatus; if actual combat could be avoided then male and female soldiers could wage war on equal terms. However, technological advancement remains unequal and so the gender situation is different in different contexts, depending on development and security issues. | gold:	A
predicted:	Answer: C. Illegal trading by states is the primary way in which weapons purchased legally might end up on the illegal arms market. | gold:	D
predicted:	A. Human security has put particular emphasis on the nexus between conflict and development, a concept which is very useful. The significance of the nexus between development and conflict is not just that it raises ethical issues about human suffering and inequalities, but that its frequent outcomes, so called state future, has dire local, regional, and global effects. | gold:	D
predicted:	C. Critical Security Studies is a post-positivist approach. | gold:	A
predicted:	A. Military forces can be linked to environmental security by bolstering social institutions and cohesion, as well as providing the resources to manage and enforce environmental regulations. Additionally, military forces can be tasked with responding to environmental disasters and supporting research and monitoring into environmentalally sustainable practices. | gold:	B
predicted:	B. Export controls protecting technological advantage and further foreign policy objectives. | gold:	A
predicted:	A. Market place scholars argue that transnational crime operates like a capitalist marketplace in its scope and extensity of operations. Criminal organizations are thus very resilient to law enforcement efforts by virtue of their sheer size. Of comparative difference is the development of highly sophisticated networks of collaboration between criminal groups that has enabled them to survive under the conditions of the competitive logic of the marketplace. | gold:	D
predicted:	A. Warlord politics was a new phenomenon which represented the opportunistic exploitation of hollowed out state institutions and fragmented armed forces. The answer is A. | gold:	A
predicted:	Chemical weapons can be used to cause mass casualties, create an atmosphere of fear and confusion, and affect the environment. They can be dispersed in aerosols, gases, or vapors and can be tailored to create a wide range of effects. Additionally, chemical weapons can be used to incapacitate and capture targets, disrupt communication and commerce, and create a smokescreen to conceal other activities. | gold:	D
predicted:	A. War is best regarded as a rational instrument of political policy; it is a continuation of politics by other means. | gold:	A
predicted:	A. Compellence and coercion through diplomacy are linked with the 'pre-emptive use of force'. | gold:	A
predicted:	A. Isolation of the effect that the threat of force or the limited use of force, in a given case is dependent on the sufficiency of the "stick" for success. The question to ask is whether the stick employed was sufficient to produce compliance. | gold:	D
predicted:	The environment can be considered a security concern in several ways. Aside from the traditional notions of environmental security, there is the potential for conflict over natural resources, the effects of climate change, and the displacement of people due to environmental disasters. Additionally, a deteriorating environment can be used to undermine a country's economic and social stability, creating a fertile ground for an insurgency or revolution. 

In conclusion, environmental security should be taken seriously as it can be a source of both conflict and stability. A country's environmental conditions can be a major factor in its overall security and stability. | gold:	D
predicted:	A. Liberalism holds that international organisations can enhance national and international security. It advocates the inclusion of non-governmental organisations and other actors to encourage cooperation and build communities. | gold:	A
predicted:	A. All of the below. | gold:	D
predicted:	A. Cost of imports soar, including vital resources such as imported medicines. Basic food prices rise, putting even greater pressure on already stretched household budgets. | gold:	D
predicted:	A. The global political arena is dominated by a paradigm of human-security which promotes human security based on core assumptions of what it is to be secure, and which transcend cultural or political diversity. | gold:	C
predicted:	A. Devaluation to promote exports and raise the price of imports. | gold:	C
predicted:	A. Military professionals believe that the majority of biological agents can be sufficiently stable in their effects to be used as a weapon. | gold:	C
predicted:	The Copenhagen School views security as a socially constructed entity, whilst Critical Security Studies regards security to be an empirically definable state. This means that the Copenhagen School views security as a part of a social construct that is ever-evolving and is shaped by society, rather than an objective state that is independent of society. In contrast, Critical Security Studies views security as an empirically definable state, meaning that it believes security to be measurable and observable, regardless of the ever-changing nature of society. | gold:	A
predicted:	Fission nuclear weapons are of the gun-type variety. | gold:	D
predicted:	A. HIV/AIDS is a newly emergent disease that did not exist until relatively late in the 20th century. | gold:	B
predicted:	C. To prevent the securitization of irrelevant threats and to challenge the legitimacy of currently securitized threats. | gold:	A
predicted:	A. The term'medicalization' refers to the process whereby a medical or health issue becomes securitized. | gold:	D
predicted:	A. Health has long been regarded as a security issue. During the 20th century there was an increasingly sense of panic about the potential damage of a serious pandemic disease outbreak in the newly globalised world. Medical advances and a series of successful containment efforts have largely allayed these fears. | gold:	D
predicted:	C. Peace studies emerged as a response to the developing nuclear capability of states during the Cold War. | gold:	A
predicted:	A. Securitization encourages more efficient handling of complex problems. | gold:	D
predicted:	C. Military threats. | gold:	B
predicted:	A. An actor can have only one social identity, and this forms the basis for developing other identities. In contrast, an actor may have multiple corporate identities which vary in importance. | gold:	B
predicted:	A. Environmental change can be a cause of war between countries, largely centred on resource scarcity interrelated with conflict. There is therefore a strong connection between environmental degradation and violence; resources as strategic goals and strategic tools may cause violence if there is inequity. | gold:	D
predicted:	A. Security systems were not adequate to protect the system against attack from a hacking group, and sensitive data was lost. | gold:	B
predicted:	A. | gold:	D
predicted:	A. The inability of the state to provide stability creates a situation wherein each component of society competes to preserve its well-being thereby engendering insecurity. The condition is self-perpetuating - a semi-permanent situation of emergent anarchy because measures to secure the regime will provoke greater resistance. | gold:	A
predicted:	D. Agents and structures are mutually constituted. | gold:	C
predicted:	C. Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels. | gold:	C
predicted:	A. Elites create negative inducements for non support of the regime. | gold:	B
predicted:	B. Yes, successful arms control and deterrence strategies have been translated to cybersecurity.  Deterrence is the application of a credible threat that would discourage an adversary from initiating hostilities. In cybersecurity, this can be achieved through the implementation of effective network security measures, such as strong authentication and encryption protocols, and the use of sophisticated malware detection software. Additionally, arms control can be used to reduce the risk of escalation of hostilities in cybersecurity. For example, agreements can be reached to limit the development and deployment of cyberweapons, or to create safe harbors and refrain from launching malicious cyberattacks. | gold:	C
predicted:	A. Withdrawal of support and sympathy for the terrorist group. | gold:	D
predicted:	A. The distinct phenomenon of strategic studies emerged as an imported American specialty. It emerged in the US and was exported to Europe. European security studies was "done already" kind of work. | gold:	D
predicted:	A. The physical health of armed forces is a paramount concern within the traditional security paradigm, and the threat of disease is exacerbated by the physical and sociological conditions under which military personnel operate, particularly during combat. | gold:	D
predicted:	A. Non-governmental organisations are the primary actors in modern arms control measures. | gold:	C
predicted:	C. The responsibility to rebuild. | gold:	B
predicted:	A. The term development refers to the human condition in which there is freedom from fear and want; there are sufficient resources to sustain life and this life can exist in a state free from the threat, or perceived threat, of sudden interruption. | gold:	C
predicted:	A. Eurocentrism is a style of analysis in which European societies are compared to non-European societies to produce an unbiased comparison of the relative merits of each. | gold:	B
predicted:	A. Any crime that uses computers to jeopardise or attempt to jeopardise national security. | gold:	D
predicted:	A. Human security is threatened by global inequality, because those who have not shared in the benefits of globalization can feel disempowered and vulnerable to recruitment by extremist organizations. Additionally, poverty and lack of access to education and health care can create a fertile ground for the spread of radical ideologies. Therefore, it is important to ensure that all people have access to the resources they need to feel secure and empowered. | gold:	C
predicted:	D. WMD terrorism poses a security threat that is not easily met by today's policy community or military establishments. The second strike rule is virtually obsolete because of the difficulty of locating such groups and deterrence is an unviable strategy given that objective of attacks are frequently politically, ideologically or religiously motivated. | gold:	D
predicted:	Realism views identity as an outgrowth of the international system, believing that it is the interests of states that drive their behaviour. Social constructivism views identity as an organizing principle for social action, emphasizing the shared meanings that people have and how these meanings give rise to action. Realism views identity as an output of the international system, whereas social constructivism views identity as an input that shapes the behaviour of states. | gold:	C
predicted:	Malware is a type of malicious software designed to steal, damage or corrupt data. It is usually spread through email attachments, external storage devices and malicious websites. | gold:	C
predicted:	D. Security studies creates and perpetuates claims that shape warfare, defining legitimacy, favouring some subjects and marginalising others. | gold:	D
predicted:	A. The different relationship to the concept of security is explainable through the US being more rationalist in their approach to security studies, while Europe is more reflectivist. The US values hard security measures and is more focused on implementing them, while Europe favors softer, more diplomatic approaches that emphasize international cooperation. | gold:	D
predicted:	C. Nations are defined by the boundaries and borders of the state. | gold:	C
predicted:	Feminist and critical security studies have highlighted the ways in which women are subject to gendered violence and discrimination in conflict and post-conflict settings. They have also pushed for more attention to be paid to the impact of war on women, and have helped to shape the ways in which we think about and respond to conflict. | gold:	C
predicted:	A. Prevention is normally associated with the concept of terrorism as war or crime. All governments will practice prevention (seen as repression from the terrorist perspective) by seeking to arrest or eliminate those actively involved in the violence. Security forces attack the terrorists before they strike (war) or they are arrested after the attack (crime). | gold:	A
predicted:	A. The distinction between limited force and full-scale forces can be made by assessing the level of violence used, the size of the force deployed, and the degree of destruction caused. Limited forces are generally used to achieve a specific objective and do not seek to overthrow the existing order, while full-scale forces are used when a state seeks to achieve a radical shift in the status quo. | gold:	D
predicted:	A. The most obvious issue of joint concern during the 2000s was terror and order. | gold:	D
predicted:	D. Vectors of economic incentives. | gold:	D
predicted:	B. The state and state apparatus. | gold:	A
predicted:	A. Coercive diplomacy is hard because it relies on the adversary's calculation that force will be used, which is often based on their perception that their vital interests are threatened. This can lead to lengthy resolution discussions because the adversary may be able to calculate that they have the upper hand and can extract concessions. Additionally, coercive diplomacy can leave too much room for compromise, making it difficult to achieve the desired results. | gold:	C
